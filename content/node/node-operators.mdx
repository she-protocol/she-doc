# SHE Node Operations

This guide covers the detailed operational aspects of running a SHE node,
including configuration management, maintenance procedures, and best practices
for stable and performant operations.

## Configuration Management

### Directory Structure

The SHE node configuration is stored in `~/.she/config/`:

```bash copy
~/.she/config/
├── app.toml          # Application configuration (gas fees, API settings, pruning, etc.)
├── client.toml       # CLI and client-related settings
├── config.toml       # Core Tendermint settings (network, consensus, and RPC)
├── genesis.json      # Chain genesis file, defines initial state
├── node_key.json     # Unique node identity key for peer-to-peer (P2P) networking
└── priv_validator_key.json  # Validator private signing key (if running as a validator)
```

### Essential Configuration Parameters

#### Network Settings (config.toml)

```toml copy
[p2p]
# Public IP for other nodes to reach you
external_address = "your-public-ip:26656"
# Local address to listen for incoming P2P connections
laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:26656"
# Number of peers allowed
max_num_inbound_peers = 40
max_num_outbound_peers = 20
# Network bandwidth limits to prevent congestion
send_rate = 20480000  # 20MB/s
recv_rate = 20480000  # 20MB/s

[rpc]
# RPC listen address
laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:26657"
# Maximum number of simultaneous connections
max_open_connections = 900
# Transaction confirmation timeout
timeout_broadcast_tx_commit = "10s"
```

#### Application Settings (app.toml)

```toml copy
# Minimum gas prices [to prevent spam transactions]
minimum-gas-prices = "0.01ushe"

[api]
# Enable the API server
enable = true
max-open-connections = 1000

[state-commit]
# Use SheDB for improved performance
sc-enable = true

[state-store]
# Enable state store for historical queries
ss-enable = true
# Retain 100,000 blocks for queryability
# 0 = "keep all"
ss-keep-recent = 100000
```

## Database Management

### Database Types

SHE supports two database backends:

1. **SheDB (Recommended)**

   - Optimized for performance and sync times
   - Reduces resource usage
   - Best for all nodes

2. **Legacy IAVL DB**
   - Standard Cosmos SDK database
   - More widely tested

### SHE-DB Configuration

```toml copy
[state-commit]
sc-enable = true
sc-async-commit-buffer = 100
sc-keep-recent = 1  # Keep only the most recent state for performance
sc-snapshot-interval = 10000  # Take state snapshots every 10,000 blocks

[state-store]
ss-enable = true
ss-backend = "pebbledb"  # Default, required
ss-async-write-buffer = 100
ss-keep-recent = 100000  # Keep last 100,000 blocks
ss-prune-interval = 600  # Cleanup interval for pruning
```

Setting very small [more frequent] pruning intervals may cause issues with automated
snapshotting in the event those events collide. Too large [less frequent]
pruning intervals means it will take a longer overall time to prune which may
cause missed blocks and excessive resync time.

### Database Maintenance

The database is typically stable and can be left alone, although some attention
may be required:

```bash copy
# Check database size
du -sh ~/.she/data/

# Confirm correct file paths as per your own setup before proceeding
# Before performing a database wipe, ensure you back up essential files:
# - `node_key.json`: Preserves node identity to maintain peer connections.
# - `priv_validator_key.json`: Critical for validators; losing this key results in double signing risks.
# - `config.toml` & `app.toml`: Retains node-specific configuration.
# - `genesis.json`: Required for correct chain initialization.

# Compact database to optimize storage (only if needed)
find ~/.she/data/ -mindepth 1 ! -name 'priv_validator_state.json' -delete && rm -rf ~/.she/wasm


# Backup database
cp -r ~/.she/data/ ~/she-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)/
```

## Service Management

### Systemd Commands

```bash copy
# Check service status
systemctl status shed

# Start service
systemctl start shed

# Stop service
systemctl stop shed

# Restart service
systemctl restart shed

# View logs in real time
journalctl -fu shed -o cat
```

### Log Management

Prevent logs from consuming excessive disk space by enabling rotation:

```bash copy
sudo tee /etc/logrotate.d/she > /dev/null << EOF
/var/log/she/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 14
    compress
    delaycompress
    notifempty
    create 0640 she she
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        systemctl reload shed
    endscript
}
EOF
```

## Update Procedures

### Minor Updates

For minor updates that are non-consensus-breaking:

```bash copy
# Stop node
sudo systemctl stop shed

# Update binary
cd she-chain
git fetch --all
git checkout [new-version]
make install

# Restart node
sudo systemctl restart shed
```

### Major Updates

For major upgrades that introduce state-breaking changes:

1. Wait for the designated upgrade block height [this can be seen in the upgrade
   proposal under 'plan']
2. The node will halt automatically.
3. Update/replace the binary
4. Restart the node.

```bash copy
# After node halts
cd she-chain
git pull
git checkout [new-version]
make install
sudo systemctl restart shed
```

_Tip - build the upgrade before the halt-height so you can quickly replace it
with minimal downtime_

## Performance Optimization

Performance optimizations can yield different results depending on your system's
hardware, workload, and network conditions. Before implementing any changes,
research and test them in a controlled environment to ensure they align with
your specific configuration and requirements. Always back up important data
before making modifications.

### Memory Management (sysctl tuning)

Optimizing memory management settings can help improve performance and
stability, particularly for high-load nodes. These settings control swap usage
and the handling of dirty (unwritten) pages in RAM.

```bash copy
vm.swappiness = 1  # Reduce swapping to disk, ensuring RAM is used efficiently before relying on slower swap space
vm.dirty_background_ratio = 3  # The percentage of system memory that can be filled with "dirty" pages before background writing begins
vm.dirty_ratio = 10  # The maximum percentage of system memory that can be filled with "dirty" pages before a full flush is triggered
vm.dirty_expire_centisecs = 300  # Time (in hundredths of a second) before dirty data is written to disk
vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs = 100  # Frequency (in hundredths of a second) at which the system writes "dirty" pages to disk
```

### Network Stack Optimization

Tuning the network stack can enhance packet processing efficiency and
throughput, particularly for nodes handling a large number of peers and high
transaction volume.

```bash copy
net.core.somaxconn = 32768  # max connections in queued
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 32768  # packets allowed in queue before dropping incoming packets
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 16384  # outstanding SYN requests (half-open connections) allowed before dropping new connections
net.core.rmem_max = 16777216  # receive buffer size for network sockets
net.core.wmem_max = 16777216  # send buffer size for network sockets
```

### Storage Optimization

Optimizing storage settings can significantly reduce write latency and improve
database performance, especially for nodes using NVMe SSDs.

```bash copy
echo "none" > /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/scheduler  # disable I/O scheduler to reduce latency
blockdev --setra 4096 /dev/nvme0n1  # readahead value to optimize sequential reads
```

## Backup and Recovery

### Regular Backups

Automate backups to avoid data loss:

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_DIR="/backup/she"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Stop service
systemctl stop shed

# Create backup
tar czf $BACKUP_DIR/she-backup-$DATE.tar.gz ~/.she/

# Restart service
systemctl start shed
```

### Recovery Procedure

Restoring from backup in case of corruption or accidental deletion:

```bash copy
# Stop node
systemctl stop shed

# Remove corrupted data
rm -rf ~/.she/data/

# Restore from backup
tar xzf she-backup-[date].tar.gz -C /

# Restart node
systemctl start shed
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Fixes

1. **Sync Problems**

   - Check available disk space (`df -h`)
   - Ensure proper peer connections (`shed net info`)
   - Verify firewall settings (port 26656 open)

2. **Performance Issues**

   - Monitor system resources (`htop` or `iotop`)
   - Check disk I/O performance (`iostat`)
   - Analyze network traffic (`iftop`)

3. **Database Issues**

   - Run database integrity checks using:

     ```bash copy
     shed debug dump-db | grep -i error
     ```

     If errors are detected, consider restoring from a recent backup.

   - Consider pruning excessive historical data by adjusting `ss-keep-recent` in
     `app.toml` or running:

     ```bash copy
     shed unsafe-reset-all --home=$HOME/.she --keep-addr-book
     ```

     Alternatively, manually remove old state snapshots to free up space:

     ```bash copy
     rm -rf ~/.she/data/snapshots/*
     ```

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash copy
# Check sync status
shed status | jq .SyncInfo

# View peer count
shed net info | jq '.n_peers'

# Check validator status
shed query staking validator $(shed keys show -a $VALIDATOR_KEY)

# View recent blocks
shed query blocks recent
```

## Security Considerations

- Use firewalls and rate-limiting to prevent attacks
- Keep your system and node software updated
- Secure SSH access with key-based authentication
- Protect validator keys with offline storage or hardware security modules
  (HSMs)

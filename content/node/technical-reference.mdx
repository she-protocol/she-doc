# SHE Technical Reference

This guide serves as a comprehensive reference for SHE node operators and
validators, providing detailed command syntax, configuration parameters, and
troubleshooting procedures. For API documentation, please refer to our API
Documentation section.

## Command Line Interface Reference

The `shed` binary provides extensive functionality for managing your SHE node.
Understanding these commands is essential for effective node operation and
troubleshooting.

shed tendermint show-validator

# Query node information
shed query node info
```

### Key Management

Proper key management is crucial for security. These commands help you manage
your keys effectively:

```bash copy
# Create new key
shed keys add <name> [flags]

# List all keys
shed keys list

# Delete key
shed keys delete <name>

# Export key (encrypted)
shed keys export <name>

shed keys import <name> <keyfile>

# Show key address
shed keys show <name> -a
```

### Transaction Commands

These commands allow you to interact with the blockchain:

```bash copy
# Send tokens
shed tx bank send <from-key> <to-address> <amount>ushe [flags]

# Delegate tokens
shed tx staking delegate <validator-addr> <amount>ushe --from <delegator-key>

# Withdraw rewards
shed tx distribution withdraw-rewards <validator-addr> --from <delegator-key>

# Edit validator
shed tx staking edit-validator [flags] --from <validator-key>
```

## Configuration Parameters

Understanding configuration parameters is essential for optimizing your node's
performance and security.

### App.toml Parameters

ss-backend = "pebbledb"
ss-keep-recent = 100000
ss-prune-interval = 600
```

</details>

### Config.toml Parameters

max_num_outbound_peers = 10
allowed_pools = ""
max_packet_msg_payload_size = 10240
handshake_timeout = "20s"
dial_timeout = "3s"

# RPC Configuration
[rpc]
laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:26657"
cors_allowed_origins = []
cors_allowed_methods = ["HEAD", "GET", "POST"]
cors_allowed_headers = ["Origin", "Accept", "Content-Type", "X-Requested-With", "X-Server-Time"]
max_open_connections = 900
timeout_broadcast_tx_commit = "10s"

# Consensus Configuration
[consensus]
wal_file = "data/cs.wal/wal"
timeout_propose = "3s"
timeout_propose_delta = "500ms"
timeout_prevote = "1s"
timeout_prevote_delta = "500ms"
timeout_precommit = "1s"
timeout_precommit_delta = "500ms"
timeout_commit = "1s"
double_sign_check_height = 0
```

</details>

## Error Codes and Troubleshooting

Understanding common errors and their solutions helps maintain a healthy node
operation.

### Common Error Codes

Here are the most frequent errors you might encounter and their solutions:

#### Consensus Errors

When you encounter consensus errors, quick and appropriate action is essential:

```text copy
Error: "Consensus failure - height halted"
Solution: Check for network upgrades or chain halts
Command: shed status | jq .sync_info

Error: "Private validator file not found"
Solution: Restore validator key or check file permissions
Location: ~/.she/config/priv_validator_key.json

Error: "Duplicate signature"
Solution: IMMEDIATELY STOP NODE - potential double signing risk
Action: Check validator operation on other machines
```

#### Network Errors

Network errors can prevent your node from participating in consensus:

```text copy
Error: "Dial tcp connection refused"
Solution: Check network connectivity and firewall rules
Commands:
  - netstat -tulpn | grep shed
  - ufw status

Error: "No peers available"
Solution: Verify peer connections and network config
Commands:
  - shed net_info
  - curl localhost:26657/net_info
```

#### Database Errors

Database corruption can require immediate attention:

```text copy
Error: "Database is corrupted"
Solution: Reset database or restore from backup
Commands:
  - shed tendermint unsafe-reset-all
  - cp -r backup/data ~/.she/
```

### Diagnostic Commands

These commands help you investigate issues and monitor your node:

```bash copy
# Check node synchronization
shed status | jq '.sync_info'

# View peer connections
shed net_info | jq '.result.peers[] | {node_info: {id: .node_info.id, moniker: .node_info.moniker}}'

# Check validator status
shed query staking validator $(shed tendermint show-validator)

# Monitor real-time logs
journalctl -u shed -f -o cat

# View system resource usage
top -p $(pgrep shed)
```

## Network Parameters

Understanding network parameters helps you operate your node effectively.

### Chain Parameters

These parameters define the network's behavior:

```text copy
Block Time: 1 second target
Max Validators: 100
Unbonding Period: 21 days
Slashing Conditions:
  - Downtime: 0.01%
  - Double Sign: 5%
  - Oracle Miss: 0.01%
Minimum Self Delegation: 1 SHE
Maximum Commission Rate: 20%
Maximum Commission Change Rate: 1% per day
```

### Port Configuration

Understanding port usage is crucial for network configuration:

```text copy
26656: P2P Communication
26657: RPC Interface
1317: REST API
9090: gRPC
26660: Prometheus Metrics
```

## File Locations

Understanding the purpose and location of important files helps with maintenance
and troubleshooting:

```text copy

## 1. System Requirements

Before beginning your SHE node setup, verify that your system meets the
following minimum requirements:

### Hardware Specifications

| Component   | Minimum      | Recommended  | Notes                                                      |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU**     | 8 cores      | 16 cores     | Modern processor (Intel Xeon/Core i7/i9 or AMD Epyc/Ryzen) |
| **RAM**     | 32GB         | 64GB         | DDR4 or better                                             |
| **Storage** | 1TB NVMe SSD | 2TB NVMe SSD | High IOPS required; SATA SSDs are not recommended          |
| **Network** | 1Gbps        | 2Gbps        | Low latency connection is critical                         |

### **Base System Setup**

#### **1. Update and Upgrade System**

Before installing any dependencies, ensure your system is up to date:

```bash copy
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

#### **2. Install Essential Packages**

Install required system dependencies:

```bash copy
sudo apt install make gcc git jq chrony curl lz4 wget tar build-essential -y
```

#### **3. Synchronize System Time**

Ensure your system clock is synchronized to prevent issues with block verification, IBC transfers, and Tendermint-based chains.

- **Set Timezone to UTC** (Recommended)

```bash copy
sudo timedatectl set-timezone UTC
```

- **Enable and Start Chrony**

```bash copy
sudo systemctl enable --now chronyd
```

If you're using **ntpd** instead:

```bash copy
sudo apt install ntp -y
sudo systemctl enable --now ntp
```

Verify time synchronization:

```bash copy
timedatectl
```

---

## **4. Install Go (Golang)**

### **Suggested Version: `Go 1.22.x`**

- **Do NOT use Go 1.23.x** (incompatible).
- Older versions **may work** but are not recommended.

#### **Check for Existing Go Installation**

Run:

```bash copy
go version
```

If a version **lower than 1.21** or **equal to / higher than 1.23** is installed, remove it:

```bash copy
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
```

#### **Download and Install Go 1.22.x**

- Download the latest **Go 1.22.x** release:

```bash copy
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

- Extract and install:

```bash copy
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

- Add Go to your environment variables (for Bash or Zsh):

```bash copy
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

- Verify installation:

```bash copy
go version
```

Expected output:

```bash copy
go version go1.22.0 linux/amd64
```

## 2. Quick Start Options

### 2.1 Automated Setup Script (Development/Testing)

For rapid deployment or testing environments, use our automated setup script.
This option is ideal when you want a quick way to spin up a node without diving
deep into manual configuration:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/she-protocol/she-chain
cd she-chain
python3 scripts/run-node.py
```

The script will guide you through selecting:

- **Network:** (mainnet, testnet, or local)
- **Database backend:** (with `she-db` recommended)
- **Basic configuration options**

### 2.2 Production Setup Overview

In general, setup follows this sequence:

1. **Install the `shed` Binary**
2. **Configure Your Node**
3. **Initialize the Chain**
4. **Set Up and Start the Node Service**

---

## 3. Installation of the SHE Binary

Choose one of the following methods:

### Option 1: Pre-built Binary

```bash copy
wget -O shed https://github.com/she-protocol/she-chain/releases/download/[version]/shed-[version]-linux-amd64
sudo mv shed /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/shed
```

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/she-protocol/she-chain
cd she-chain
git checkout [version]  # See below for version reference
make install
```

To determine the correct version for any given network (mainnet/testnet/devnet)
please refer to [this table](./reference)

---

## 4. Node Initialization and Basic Configuration

### 4.1 Initialize Your Node

Set your nodeâ€™s moniker and chain ID, then initialize the node:

```bash copy
# Set a "name" name and the relevant chain-id [pacific-1 / atlantic-2 / arctic-1]
MONIKER="your-node-name"
CHAIN_ID="pacific-1"

## Initialize node
shed init $MONIKER --chain-id $CHAIN_ID
```

### 4.2 Update Essential Settings

Confirm the minimum gas prices (min 0.02ushe) by updating the `app.toml` file:

```bash copy
sed -i 's/minimum-gas-prices = ""/minimum-gas-prices = "0.02ushe"/g' ~/.she/config/app.toml
```

---

## 5. Advanced Synchronization Options

Depending on your operational requirements, choose one of the following
synchronization methods:

### 5.1 State Sync Configuration (Non-Archive Nodes)

State sync enables your node to rapidly catch up by fetching a recent snapshot
from trusted peers rather than replaying all historical blocks.

#### Steps

**Edit the `[statesync]` Section:**
In `~/.she/config/config.toml`, update or add the following persistent peers:

```toml copy
d7ad900ff4bd1cdb37b69ce0ae631b98ef2506e7@p2p.state-sync-0.pacific-1.shenetwork.io:26656,
c79ecbb4f2f139b5a0eb3a3b323ea77e3b11387c@p2p.state-sync-1.pacific-1.shenetwork.io:26656,
ce46d5f39f30b62bc2f899a914f971daf53519dc@p2p.state-sync-2.pacific-1.shenetwork.io:26656
```

**Automate Trust Parameter Configuration:**

Use the following script to dynamically set the trust height and hash based on a
provided RPC endpoint:

<details>
<summary>click to expand</summary>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if RPC URL or IP:PORT is provided
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <rpc_url_or_ip:port>"
  exit 1
fi

RPCADDR=$1
CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/.she/config/config.toml"

# Fetch current height and latest block hash from /status
STATUS_DATA=$(curl -s "$RPCADDR/status" | jq -r '.sync_info.latest_block_height + " " + .sync_info.latest_block_hash')
CURRENT_HEIGHT=$(echo "$STATUS_DATA" | cut -d' ' -f1)
LATEST_HASH=$(echo "$STATUS_DATA" | cut -d' ' -f2)

if [ -z "$CURRENT_HEIGHT" ] || [ -z "$LATEST_HASH" ]; then
  echo "Error: Could not fetch current height or latest block hash from $RPCADDR"
  exit 1
fi

# Adjust the current height for safety
ADJUSTED_HEIGHT=$((CURRENT_HEIGHT - 9000))
ROUNDED_HEIGHT=$(( (ADJUSTED_HEIGHT / 10000) * 10000 + 1 ))
TRUST_HEIGHT=$ROUNDED_HEIGHT

# Fetch trust hash for the calculated trust height
BLOCK_DATA=$(curl -s "$RPCADDR/block?height=$TRUST_HEIGHT" | jq -r '.block_id.hash')
TRUST_HASH=$BLOCK_DATA

if [ -z "$TRUST_HASH" ]; then
  echo "Error: Could not fetch trust hash for height $TRUST_HEIGHT from $RPCADDR"
  exit 1
fi

# Update the config.toml file
if [ -f "$CONFIG_FILE" ]; then
  sed -i "s/^enable = .*/enable = true/" "$CONFIG_FILE"
  sed -i "s/^use-p2p = .*/use-p2p = true/" "$CONFIG_FILE"
  sed -i "s/^trust-height = .*/trust-height = $TRUST_HEIGHT/" "$CONFIG_FILE"
  sed -i "s/^trust-hash = .*/trust-hash = \"$TRUST_HASH\"/" "$CONFIG_FILE"

  echo "Updated $CONFIG_FILE with the following values:"
  echo "  trust-height = $TRUST_HEIGHT"
  echo "  trust-hash = $TRUST_HASH"
else
  echo "Error: Config file $CONFIG_FILE not found."
  exit 1
fi
```

</details>

**Usage:**

```bash copy
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh <rpc_url>
```

_Engsure that the `[statesync]` section already contains the persistent peers
listed above._

---

### 5.2 Archive Node Configuration

An archive node maintains the complete historical record of the chain. This
requires disabling state sync and starting with a pre-existing database using a
"snapshot".

**Disable State Sync:**
In `~/.she/config/config.toml`, modify the `[statesync]` section as follows:

```toml copy
#######################################################
###         State Sync Configuration Options        ###
#######################################################
[statesync]
enable = false
```

**Configure Archive Node Peers:**
To sync from the height your snapshot was created at, you need peers retaining
a large amount of historical blocks. These specific peers should be used during
initial sync, which can be changed at a later time.

```toml copy
2b0cbaac0ea04011b9f2eba189acad93649dfeb2@88.99.11.133:26656
35d3de63eb8f4c3b08eb0349c6e89ff536466861@88.198.0.190:26656
```

**Restore from Snapshot:**
Archive nodes must restore from a trusted, full historical snapshot. There may
be several providers, here is one of them:

### Archive Snapshot Resources

**Latest Snapshot JSON:**
The snapshots are rotated weeekly - current/most recent snapshot details are
maintained in this JSON:

```json copy
{
  "network": "pacific-1",
  "height": "128127546",
  "type": "archive",
  "mirror": "EU",
  "url": "https://dl-eu2.ccvalidators.com/SNAPSHOTS/archive/she/pacific-1_128127546.tar.lz4",
  "filename": "pacific-1_128127546.tar.lz4",
  "date": "2025-01-26 07:51",
  "database": "shedb",
  "size": "6.3T",
  "provider": "CryptoCrew"
}
```

#### Snapshot Restoration

- Stop the node service

```bash copy
  sudo systemctl stop shed
```

- Remove Existing Data Directory

```bash copy
mv ~/.she/data ~/.she/data_backup_$(date +%s)
```

- Download and Extract the Snapshot: Follow the instructions from the linked
  markdown file or use a command similar to:

```bash copy
wget -O snapshot.tar.lz4 "https://dl-eu2.ccvalidators.com/SNAPSHOTS/archive/she/pacific-1_128127546.tar.lz4"
lz4 -d snapshot.tar.lz4 | tar -x -C ~/.she
```

- Restart the node service

```bash copy
sudo systemctl start shed
```

## 6. Mempool Configuration Tuning

For optimal transaction handling and resource management, it is suggested to
update the mempool settings in your `config.toml` file as follows:

```toml copy
#######################################################
###          Mempool Configuration Option          ###
#######################################################
[mempool]

# Broadcast transactions to other nodes
broadcast = true

# Maximum number of transactions in the mempool
size = 5000

# Limit the total size of all txs in the mempool.
max-txs-bytes = 10737418240

# Size of the cache (used to filter duplicate transactions)
cache-size = 10000

# Do not remove invalid transactions from the cache
keep-invalid-txs-in-cache = false

# Maximum size of a single transaction
max-tx-bytes = 2048576

# Maximum size of a batch of transactions to send to a peer
max-batch-bytes = 0

# Time-to-live duration for transactions in the mempool
ttl-duration = "3s"

# Maximum number of blocks a transaction can remain in the mempool
ttl-num-blocks = 5

tx-notify-threshold = 0

check-tx-error-blacklist-enabled = false

check-tx-error-threshold = 0

pending-size = 5000

max-pending-txs-bytes = 1073741824

pending-ttl-duration = "3s"

pending-ttl-num-blocks = 5
```

> **Notice:** Adjust these parameters if you encounter performance or resource issues.

---

## 7. Service Setup with systemd

Setting up a systemd service ensures that your node starts automatically on boot
and restarts if it crashes.

```bash copy
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/shed.service > /dev/null << EOF
[Unit]
Description=SHE Node
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=$(which shed) start
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=65535

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable shed
sudo systemctl start shed
```

> **Note:** Verify that the `User` field is correct for your environment. If
> running under a different user, update accordingly.

---

## 8. Verification and Troubleshooting

### 8.1 Verify Your Setup

Run the following commands to confirm your nodeâ€™s status:

```bash copy
# View sync status
shed status | jq .SyncInfo

# Check live logs
journalctl -u shed -f -o cat
```

Your node is properly set up when:

- The sync status shows `"catching_up": false`
- Logs indicate blocks are being processed

### 8.2 Common Troubleshooting Tips

#### Sync Issues

- Verify that you have sufficient disk space.
- Ensure stable network connectivity.
- Confirm that system time is correctly synchronized.
- Use state sync for a rapid initial sync (note: not applicable for archive
  nodes).

#### Performance Problems

- Monitor system resources (CPU, RAM, I/O).
- Evaluate disk performance and network bandwidth.
- Adjust mempool and persistent-peer settings if necessary.

#### Network Connectivity

- Confirm that firewall rules allow required ports (e.g., 26656, 26657, 9090).
- Check that DNS resolution is working correctly.
- Verify peer connectivity by reviewing system logs and node info through the
  RPC [localhost:26657/net_info]

## 9. Next Steps

After your node is up and running, consider the following:

1. **Monitoring & Alerting:** Set up tools to monitor node health and
   performance.
2. **Security Best Practices:** Harden your server (firewall, SSH keys, etc.).
3. **Backup Procedures:** Regularly backup your configuration and data
   directories.

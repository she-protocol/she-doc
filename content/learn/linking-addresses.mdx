# Linking SHE and EVM / 0x Addresses

Each SHE address in SHE V2 has a corresponding EVM / 0x address, and vice versa.
When you use SHE V2 for the first time, it is necessary to link these two
addresses.

<Callout type="warning">**Important Note:** You cannot decide which SHE and 0x addresses are linked together. Each SHE account has exactly one specific SHE address, and one specific EVM / 0x address, associated with it. They are like 2 sides of the same coin, and cannot be combined with other addresses.</Callout>

You can link your SHE and EVM / 0x addresses using the SHE app:
https://app.she.io/

1. Navigate to https://app.she.io/ using your web browser.
2. On the Dashboard, look for the "Addresses" box.
3. Complete captcha, if required.
4. Click the "Link Addresses" button.

   This will prompt you to sign a message with your wallet - it's not a transaction, and will not charge you any gas fees.
   <ImageWithCaption img={signMessageImage} alt="Sign message" />
5. Once you have signed that message, your accounts will be linked!

### Wallet Addresses

Every account on SHE has a unique public key. In SHE V2, this public key
translates into two different types of addresses:

- **EVM Address**: This address starts with `0x` and is used for EVM-based
  activities.

- **SHE Address**: This address starts with `she` and is used for SHE-native
  activities.

Although these addresses appear different, they actually share the same
underlying account. This means whatever action you take with one address will
also affect the other.

If you deposit funds into your EVM address, you can access and use those same
funds with your SHE address, and vice versa. They are linked together as one
account, ensuring seamless integration between the EVM and SHE ecosystems.

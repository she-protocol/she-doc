# Connect to SHE

This getting started guide will help you set up your wallet and start using SHE,
even if you're new to blockchain. By the end, you'll be ready to explore the
most performant blockchain ever.

## Requirements

- A compatible, non-custodial wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/),
  or [Compass](https://compasswallet.io/).
- SHE tokens [from an exchange](learn/getting-tokens), or stablecoins in your
  personal wallet.

For additional help with wallet apps, see our
[Setting up a Wallet](learn/wallet-setup) guide.

## Connecting Your Wallet

For a quick setup, simply click the "Connect Wallet" button below to connect
directly from this guide.

<EvmWalletConnect />

After connecting, your wallet will automatically prompt you to join the correct
SHE network.

> If your wallet doesnâ€™t automatically prompt you to join the SHE Network,
> please add it manually by following the network details
> [here](/user-guides/wallet-setup).

After connection, you're ready to dive in, the demo below walks you through connecting to the SHE
network step-by-step.

## Dual Address Support

SHE supports two wallet address types:

- **EVM (0x) address:** Ethereum-style addresses prefixed with "0x".
- **SHE address:** Native SHE blockchain addresses prefixed with "she1".

Both addresses are derived from the same public key, ensuring seamless asset
integration across formats. You can find your corresponding wallet addresses
directly in the SHE app.

For more details on interoperability, explore our article
[here](https://blog.she.io/she-v2-interoperability/).

### How to Link Your Addresses

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">Linking addresses is recommended for all users to enable cross-VM functionality in many SHE apps.</Callout>

To use interoperability features in SHE apps, youâ€™ll need to link your SHE and
EVM (0x) addresses. Each SHE address has a corresponding EVM address, derived
from the same public key, and this link is required on your first use.

<Callout type="warning">Address linking is automaticâ€”each SHE account is tied to a single SHE address and a single EVM address, both derived from the same public key.</Callout>

Follow these steps to link your SHE and EVM addresses:

1. Go to [app.she.io](https://app.she.io) in your browser.
2. In the Dashboard, locate the "Addresses" box.
3. Complete any required captcha.
4. Click "Link Addresses" to start the process. Youâ€™ll be prompted to sign a
   message with your walletâ€”this is not a transaction and incurs no gas fees.
5. Once signed, your SHE and EVM addresses will be linked.

For more details, check the [Linking Addresses guide](learn/linking-addresses).

### How to View Your Address Pair

You can view your wallet address on any SHE blockchain explorer to see your
transactions and balances.

<SheTraceSearch />

Alternatively, users can interact with SHE directly via API endpoints.

## Onboarding from Centralized Exchanges

If you're transitioning from a CEX, using both SHE and 0x addresses is simple.
CEXs will upgrade to support both over time.

### Withdrawing to a SHE Address

Copy your **she1...** address and paste it into the withdrawal page of your CEX.

<Callout type="warning">No memo is required for withdrawals, but depositing back to a CEX may require a memo. Check your CEX's guidelines to ensure smooth transfers.</Callout>

### Withdrawing to an EVM/0x Address

To withdraw to an 0x address, you must first link it to your SHE address. Follow
the steps in the [Linking Addresses guide](user-guides/linking-addresses).

If your addresses aren't linked, visit the Dashboard on the
[SHE App](https://app.she.io) to check or link them.

## Bridging to SHE

Upcomming

### Gas on Arrival

Some bridges offer a "gas on arrival" feature, providing a small amount of SHE
tokens to cover initial transaction fees. To find these options, open the SHE
App, go to the "Bridge" section, select your source chain and asset, and view
the recommended third-party bridges. Bridges with "gas on arrival" support are
typically labeled in the app, making it easy to identify them. If no label
appears, check the bridge provider's official documentation or website for the
latest "gas on arrival" information.

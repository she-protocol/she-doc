# Virtual Machine Interoperability

EVM and CosmWasm based smart contracts co-exist on SHE, but live in different
execution environments. This creates a challenge for users, who use wallets that
typically only support a single execution environment. Likewise for developers,
existing tooling and libraries can only interact with either EVM or Wasm (Think
EthersJS vs CosmJS).

To bridge the gap between EVM and Wasm, SHE has introduced two interoperability
features, allowing for smooth and easy interactions between both environments.
Precompiled EVM contracts and Pointer Contracts enable all contracts to be
accessible from both VM environments.

## Precompiled Contracts

SHE precompiles are smart contracts embedded directly within the SHE EVM
environment. They provide a gateway for users and developers to access native
SHE functionalities through the EVM RPC interface.

For instructions on utilizing EVM precompiles, refer to the
[Example Usage](reference/precompiles/example-usage.mdx) section.

## Pointer Contracts

Pointer Contracts are a unique feature introduced on SHE, designed to enhance
interoperability between EVM and CosmWasm environments. These contracts
facilitate the creation of links between tokens across both EVM and CosmWasm.
This enables tokens to move smoothly and be used seamlessly in both
environments.

Pointer contracts can be deployed for any Token Factory, Smart Contract (ERC20,
ERC721, etc.), and any IBC denom.

[here](../../build/pointers/overview.mdx).

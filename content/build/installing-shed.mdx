# Shed CLI

Shed is a command-line tool for interacting with the SHE blockchain. This page
will guide you through setting up Shed and introduce you to some basic commands
to get started.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.19+: Installation instructions are available
  [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).

## Installation

To install Shed, locate the version you wish to use
[here](https://github.com/she-protocol/she-chain/releases), and then execute the
following commands:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/she-protocol/she-chain
cd she-chain
git checkout v4.1.4-evm-devnet
make install
```

You can verify that Shed was installed correctly by running:

```bash copy
shed version
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you encounter an error like `command not found: shed`, you may need to set your GOPATH environment variable.

1. Use `go env GOPATH` to find your GOPATH
2. Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
   ```bash copy
   export GOPATH=[your GOPATH from step 1]
   export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
   ```

For more information see
[here](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable).

### Adding a wallet

You can create a new wallet using the `shed keys` command:

```bash copy
shed keys add $NAME
```

Please replace `$NAME` with the name you would like to use for this key. This
will generate a seed phrase and store the account in the CLI for use. Write this
mnemonic down and store it in a safe place.

Alternatively, if you would like to import an existing seed phrase, you can add
the `--recover` flag:

```bash copy
shed keys add $NAME --recover
```

You will then be prompted to input your seed phrase.

<Callout type="warning">
    If you are importing from an EVM wallet like MetaMask, you may need to specify the coin type. Ethereum (EVM) based wallets use coin type `60`, while the default on SHE is `118`.
    For example,

    ```bash copy
    shed keys add $NAME --coin-type=60
    ```

This will generate a different address than the default coin type of `118`.

</Callout>

To see your local wallets, you can run

```bash copy
shed keys list
```

to see a list of all wallets added, or

```bash copy
shed keys show $NAME
```

to see a details about a specific wallet.

# Deploying IBC Pointers

## Overview

IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) pointers allow tokens originating from
another blockchain to have an ERC-compatible representation within the SHE
network. This guide outlines the steps required to submit a governance proposal
to register an IBC token with an ERC pointer.

## Prerequisites

Before submitting a governance proposal to register an IBC pointer, ensure you
have:

- **Token metadata** (including the token denomination, name, symbol, and
  decimals).
- **Sufficient deposit** proposal submission has no cost, but to be eligible for
  voting there is a deposit, to prevent abuse.
- **Test before mainnet** especially if it's your first time, try sending the
  proposal on a testnet.

## Metadata Requirements

For an IBC token, metadata must be included in the governance proposal. The
metadata ensures the token is properly recognized within the ERC-compatible
execution environment.

### Example Metadata JSON

```json copy
{
  "id": "1",
  "title": "Register IBC Pointer",
  "description": "Register an ERC-compatible pointer for an IBC token.",
  "proposal_type": "/sheprotocol.shechain.evm.AddERCNativePointerProposalV2",
  "messages": [
    {
      "@type": "/sheprotocol.shechain.evm.AddERCNativePointerProposalV2",
      "title": "Register IBC Pointer",
      "description": "Create an ERC-compatible pointer for an IBC token.",
      "token": "ibc/<IBC_DENOM_HASH>",
      "name": "Token Name",
      "symbol": "TOKEN",
      "decimals": <DECIMALS>
    }
  ],
  "total_deposit": [
    {
      "denom": "<DEPOSIT_DENOM>",
      "amount": "<DEPOSIT_AMOUNT>"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Metadata Fields

- **`token`**: The IBC denomination hash of the token to be registered.
- **`name`**: The human-readable token name.
- **`symbol`**: The token's ticker symbol.
- **`decimals`**: The decimal precision of the token.
- **`total_deposit`**: The deposit amount required for governance consideration.

## Submitting the Governance Proposal

Use the following command to submit the proposal:

```bash copy
shed tx gov submit-proposal add-erc-native-pointer "Register IBC Pointer" "Register an ERC-compatible pointer for an IBC token" ibc/<IBC_DENOM_HASH> "Token Name" "TOKEN" <DECIMALS> <DEPOSIT_AMOUNT><DEPOSIT_DENOM> --from=<GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS> --chain-id=<CHAIN_ID> --fees=<FEE_AMOUNT><FEE_DENOM> --gas=<GAS_LIMIT>
```

### Command Breakdown

- **Proposal Title & Description**: Describes the purpose of the pointer
  registration.
- **IBC Denomination Hash**: The IBC token identifier.
- **Token Name & Symbol**: Used for display purposes.
- **Decimals**: The tokenâ€™s decimal precision.
- **Deposit**: Required governance deposit to proceed with the proposal.
- **From**: Address submitting the proposal.
- **Chain ID**: Specifies the network.
- **Fees & Gas**: Specifies transaction fees and gas limits.

## Monitoring the Proposal Status

After submission, check the proposal status with:

```bash copy
shed q gov proposal <PROPOSAL_ID>
```

### Possible Proposal Statuses

- **`PROPOSAL_STATUS_VOTING_PERIOD`**: Proposal is under review and open for
  voting.
- **`PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED`**: Proposal has been approved.
- **`PROPOSAL_STATUS_REJECTED`**: Proposal has been rejected.

## Confirming Pointer Registration

Once the proposal is passed and executed, confirm the pointer registration
using:

```bash copy
shed q evm pointer ERC20 ibc/<IBC_DENOM_HASH>
```

If the registration was successful, this query should return the associated
ERC-compatible representation of the IBC token.

## Conclusion

Registering an IBC pointer requires a governance proposal with correctly
formatted metadata. Once the proposal passes, the pointer is officially
recognized within the ERC-compatible execution environment, allowing seamless
integration across different blockchain ecosystems. Ensure all required details
are accurate before submitting the proposal to avoid delays or rejections.

# Interact with EVM on SHE via CLI

You can query or send transactions to SHE easily via CLI once you have the
`shed` command installed (see [Installing Shed](node/getting-started))

## Queries

If the machine you run these commands from are not running a node of the
network, you'll need to append `--node http://url-to-she-cosmos-rpc` to your
command. Refer to the
[Tools and Resources](providers/rpc-providers) page for a list of
RPC endpoints.

- `shed q evm she-addr [some EVM address]`: Gets the associated SHE address of
  the queried EVM address, if it exists on-chain.
- `shed q evm evm-addr [some SHE address]`: Gets the associated EVM address of
  the queried SHE address, if it exists on-chain.
- `shed q evm erc20 [erc20 address] [method] [arguments...]`: Query the ERC20
  contract at given address using the given method/arguments.
- `shed q evm payload [abi-filepath] [method] [arguments...]`: Generate the
  hexadecimal payload of the requested method call given an ABI.
- `shed q evm pointer [type] [pointee]`: Gets the pointer contract of the
  requested pointee. The `type` parameter can be one of "NATIVE", "CW20",
  "CW721", "ERC20", or "ERC721", and `pointee` is the target contract address.
  For "NATIVE" type, `pointee` would be the native denom name instead.

## Transactions

Sending transactions via CLI requires you to have keys added via
`shed keys add`. You can then specify the key you want to use by appending
`--from=[key name]` to your command.

If the machine you run these commands from are not a node of the network, you'd
need to append `--evm-rpc http://url-to-she-evm-rpc` to your command. Refer to
the [Tools and Resources](build/resources-tools-and-resources.mdx) page for a list
of RPC endpoints.

- `shed tx evm associate-address`: Associates the SHE address and EVM address
  on-chain for the sending key.
- `shed tx evm send [to EVM address] [amount in wei]`: Sends native tokens to
  the target EVM address.
- `shed tx evm deploy [path_to_binary]`: Deploys the EVM contract specified in
  `path_to_binary`.
- `shed tx evm call-contract [addr] [payload hex]`: Sends a transaction that
  calls contract at the target address with the provided payload.
- `shed tx evm erc20-send [addr] [recipient] [amount]`: Sends ERC20 tokens of
  contract at `addr` to the target recipient.
- `shed tx evm delegate [val-addr] [amount]`: Delegates specified amount to the
  target validator address. The validator address must be in SHE/Cosmos
  validator address format.

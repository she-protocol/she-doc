# Building a Frontend

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to set up a frontend project using
React. You'll learn how to connect to a SHE wallet and interact with EVM and
CosmWasm smart contracts deployed on SHE.

Select one of the tabs below to get started!

<Tabs items={["EVM", "CosmWasm"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
In this section, we'll explore SHE's unique interoperability features by building an EVM compatible DApp that interacts with a CosmWasm smart contract.
We will use [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) to build a React app that interacts with a CosmWasm smart contract using the SHE [CosmWasm precompile](https://github.com/she-protocol/she-chain/tree/main/precompiles/wasmd).

## Prerequisites

- Complete the tutorial in [cosmwasm-general](build/cosmwasm-general) to deploy
  a CosmWasm counter contract on our devnet (arctic-1).

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Node.js & NPM installed
- One of the SHE wallets listed [here](providers/wallets/wallets)

## Creating a React Project

Start by creating a new React project using Vite's TypeScript template for
streamlined development:

```bash copy
npm create vite@latest my-counter-frontend -- --template react-ts
```

This command creates a new folder with a React project using TypeScript. Open
`my-counter-frontend` in your favorite IDE.

<Callout type="info">The rest of this tutorial will be in TypeScript. If you're not using TypeScript, you can easily adjust by removing the types.</Callout>

## Installing Dependencies

Install `ethers`, an Ethereum library that facilitates interaction with the
Ethereum blockchain:

```bash copy
npm install ethers
```

## Defining Contract Addresses and ABI

In this tutorial, we will be using the **Wasm Precompile** to interact with our
CosmWasm contract from the EVM. Precompiles (short for Precompiled contracts)
are EVM compatible contracts that are built into the chain.
The Wasm Precompile
is a unique smart contract on SHE that enables EVM clients to query and execute
CosmWasm contracts. Refer to the docs on
[precompiles](reference/precompiles/example-usage) for
more details.

First, import the address and ABI of the CosmWasm precompile from `@she-js/evm`.

<Callout type="info">`@she-js` contains NPM libraries for writing applications that interact with SHE. Learn more [here](https://github.com/she-protocol/she-js/tree/main).</Callout>

`@she-js/evm` is an npm package that contains useful constants and helpers for
interacting with the EVM on SHE.

To install she-js:

```bash copy
npm install @she-js/evm
```

At the top of `App.tsx` you can then import `WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS`,
`WASM_PRECOMPILE_ABI`. These constants allow us to interact with the Wasm
Precompile.

```tsx copy
import { WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS, WASM_PRECOMPILE_ABI, WasmPrecompileContract } from '@she-js/evm';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
```

These values will be used in the app to query and execute a contract.

## Connecting to the Wallet and Initializing the Contract

Replace your main `App` component with the following:

```tsx copy filename="App.tsx"
import { WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS, SHE_CHAIN_INFO, getWasmPrecompileEthersV6Contract } from '@she-js/evm';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { BrowserProvider, Contract, toUtf8Bytes, toUtf8String } from 'ethers';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState<string>();
  const [contract, setContract] = useState<Contract>();
  const [isIncrementing, setIsIncrementing] = useState(false);

  // TODO: Replace this with your CosmWasm contract address here
  const COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'she14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9sh9m79m';

  const fetchCount = async () => {
    if (!contract) {
      return;
    }
    // Query to get the count on the counter contract
    const queryMsg = { get_count: {} };
    const queryResponse = await contract.query(COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(queryMsg)));
    const { count } = JSON.parse(toUtf8String(queryResponse));
    setCount(count);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchCount();
  }, [contract]);

  const connectWallet = async () => {
    if (window.ethereum) {
      const provider = new BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
      const { chainId } = await provider.getNetwork();
      const devnetChainId = SHE_CHAIN_INFO.devnet.chainId;
      if (chainId !== BigInt(devnetChainId)) {
        alert('Wallet is not connected to SHE EVM devnet');
        return;
      }

      const signer = await provider.getSigner();
      const contract = getWasmPrecompileEthersV6Contract(signer);

      setContract(contract);
    } else {
      alert('No EVM compatible wallet installed');
    }
  };

  const incrementCount = async () => {
    if (!contract) {
      return;
    }

    setIsIncrementing(true);
    // Execute message to increment the count on the contract
    const executeMsg = { increment: {} };
    const executeResponse = await contract.execute(
      COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(executeMsg)),
      toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify([])) // Used for sending funds if needed
    );
    // Wait for the transaction to be confirmed
    await executeResponse.wait();
    console.log(executeResponse);
    setIsIncrementing(false);
    await fetchCount();
  };

  return (
    <>
      <div className="card">
        {contract ? (
          <div>
            <h1>Count is {count}</h1>
            <button disabled={isIncrementing} onClick={incrementCount}>
              {isIncrementing ? 'incrementing...' : 'increment'}
            </button>
          </div>
        ) : (
          <button onClick={connectWallet}>Connect Wallet</button>
        )}
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Detailed outline of `App.tsx`

**State Declarations**

- `count`: Holds the current count fetched from the smart contract.
- `contract`: An instance of the ethers Contract object, used for interacting
  with the blockchain.
- `isIncrementing`: A boolean to manage UI state during contract execution

**Effect Hooks**

A single `useEffect` hook to fetch the current count whenever the contract state
changes, indicating that the contract instance is ready for interaction.

**Connecting to EVM Wallet**

A function named `connectWallet` that:

- Checks for any EVM compatible wallet extension.
- Establishes a connection to the Ethereum network via the connected wallet,
  using ethers.js BrowserProvider.
- Verifies the correct network (SHE EVM devnet) by comparing chainId.
- Creates an ethers.js Contract instance with the signer from the wallet,
  setting it in the contract state for later use.

**Fetching Contract Data**

A function named `fetchCount` that:

- Executes a contract query to get the current count.
- Parses and updates the count state with the response.

**Incrementing the Counter**

A function named `incrementCount` that:

- Sends a transaction to the smart contract to increment the count.
- Waits for the transaction to be confirmed.
- Refetches the count to update the UI with the new value.

To see your app in action, run `npm run dev` to spin up a local version of the
application. Once you connect your wallet, you should see a counter, as well as
a button you can use to increment the counter on the contract.

Congrats on deploying your first interoperable dApp on SHE!

<Tabs.Tab>
In this section, we'll use the [@she-js](https://github.com/she-protocol/she-js/) library to build a React app that interacts with a CosmWasm contract.

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Node.js & NPM installed
- A SHE wallet extension, such as:
  - [Compass](https://compasswallet.io/)
  - [Fin](https://finwallet.com/)

## Creating a React Project

If you're starting a project from scratch, consider using the TypeScript
template from Vite for easier development and debugging.

```bash copy
npm create vite@latest my-counter-frontend -- --template react-ts
```

This command creates a new folder with a React project using TypeScript. Open
`my-counter-frontend` in your favorite IDE.

<Callout type="info">The rest of this tutorial will be in TypeScript. If you're not using TypeScript, you can easily adjust by removing the types.</Callout>

## Installing Dependencies

From the terminal at the root of your project, install the required
dependencies: `@she-js/core` and `@she-js/react`.

```bash copy
npm install @she-js/core @she-js/react
```

<Callout type="info">`@she-js` contains NPM libraries for writing applications that interact with SHE. Learn more [here](https://github.com/she-protocol/she-js/tree/main).</Callout>

## Wrapping App in SheWalletProvider

Replace the code in your `App.tsx` file with the following to set up a
`SheWalletProvider` context, define your chain info, and set connection URLs.

```tsx copy
import { SheWalletProvider } from '@she-js/react';
import './App.css';
import Home from './Home.tsx';

function App() {
  return (
    // Set up SheWalletProvider for easy wallet connection and to use hooks in @she-js/react
    <SheWalletProvider
      chainConfiguration={{
        chainId: 'arctic-1',
        restUrl: 'https://rest.arctic-1.shenetwork.io',
        rpcUrl: 'https://rpc.arctic-1.shenetwork.io'
      }}
      wallets={['compass', 'fin']}>
      <Home />
    </SheWalletProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Detailed outline of `App.tsx`

**Wallet Provider Setup**

- Imports `SheWalletProvider` from the `@she-js/react` package.
- Wraps `App` with `SheWalletProvider` for wallet context.

**Chain Configuration**

- Specifies the `chainConfiguration` prop in `SheWalletProvider` to set up the
  blockchain network:
  - `chainId`: Identifies the SHE network (in this case, `arctic-1`).
  - `restUrl`: REST URL for the SHE (You may need your own provider).
  - `rpcUrl`: RPC URL for the SHE (You may need your own provider).

**Supported Wallets**

- Sets up supported wallet types (`'compass'`, `'fin'`, `'leap'`, `'keplr'`) in
  the wallets prop.

## Adding Home Component

Create a file named `Home.tsx` in your `src` directory with the following code:

```tsx copy
import { useCallback, useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useCosmWasmClient, useSigningCosmWasmClient, useWallet, WalletConnectButton } from '@she-js/react';

// arctic-1 example contract
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'she14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9sh9m79m';

function Home() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState<number | undefined>();
  const [error, setError] = useState<string>('');
  const [isIncrementing, setIsIncrementing] = useState<boolean>(false);

  // Helpful hook for getting the currently connected wallet and chain info
  const { connectedWallet, accounts } = useWallet();

  // For querying cosmwasm smart contracts
  const { cosmWasmClient: queryClient } = useCosmWasmClient();

  // For executing messages on cosmwasm smart contracts
  const { signingCosmWasmClient: signingClient } = useSigningCosmWasmClient();

  const fetchCount = useCallback(async () => {
    const response = await queryClient?.queryContractSmart(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, {
      get_count: {}
    });
    return response?.count;
  }, [queryClient]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchCount().then(setCount);
  }, [connectedWallet, fetchCount]);

  const incrementCounter = async () => {
    setIsIncrementing(true);
    try {
      const senderAddress = accounts[0].address;

      // Build message content
      const msg = { increment: {} };

      // Define gas price and limit
      const fee = {
        amount: [{ amount: '20000', denom: 'ushe' }],
        gas: '200000'
      };

      // Call smart contract execute msg
      await signingClient?.execute(senderAddress, CONTRACT_ADDRESS, msg, fee);

      // Updates the counter state again
      const updatedCount = await fetchCount();
      setCount(updatedCount);

      setIsIncrementing(false);
      setError('');
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof Error) {
        setError(error.message);
      } else {
        setError('unknown error');
      }
      setIsIncrementing(false);
    }
  };

  // Helpful component for wallet connection
  if (!connectedWallet) return <WalletConnectButton />;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count is: {count ? count : '---'}</h1>
      <button disabled={isIncrementing} onClick={incrementCounter}>
        {isIncrementing ? 'incrementing...' : 'increment'}
      </button>
      {error && <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>{error}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Home;
```

We deployed a counter contract on the `arctic-1` testnet. Contract address:
`she14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9sh9m79m`. Learn more
about this contract [here](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template).

### Detailed outline of `Home.tsx`

**Render Logic**

- Shows `WalletConnectButton` if no wallet is connected.
- Otherwise, displays the counter value and an "Increment" button.
- Disables the button when a transaction is pending.
- Catches and displays error messages, if any.

**Wallet and Client Setup**

- Utilizes `useWallet` hook from `@she-js/react` to get the connected wallet and
  accounts.
- Uses `useCosmWasmClient` and `useSigningCosmWasmClient` hooks from
  `@she-js/react` to instantiate `queryClient` and `signingClient`. The signing
  client can be used for querying, but it is not recommended to use a signing
  client when only a query client is needed.

**Fetching Counter Value**

- `fetchCount` function uses `queryClient.queryContractSmart` to query the smart
  contract with the query `{ get_count: {} }`.

**Incrementing Counter**

- `incrementCounter` function:
  - Extracts `senderAddress` from the connected wallet's accounts.
  - Builds a message with `{ increment: {} }` to be sent to the smart contract.
  - Specifies the transaction fee with gas price and gas limit.
  - Calls `signingClient.execute` to execute the contract with the built message
    and fee.

By leveraging `@she-js` and its hooks, the component provides a way to connect
to a wallet, query a CosmWasm smart contract to get the current counter state,
and increment it with an execute message.

## Running the App

Run `npm run dev` and navigate to http://localhost:5173/ to view your
application.

## Beyond Simple Contracts: Advanced CosmWasm Interactions

While our counter example demonstrated the basics of connecting to and interacting with a CosmWasm contract through the WASM precompile, CosmWasm contracts offer much more sophisticated capabilities. One of their most powerful features is their ability to describe their own interfaces, eliminating the need for external ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces) that are typically required for EVM contract interactions.

Let's explore these advanced features by building a component that interacts with a CW721 (NFT) contract. This example will demonstrate contract discovery, handling different response formats, and implementing robust error handling - skills that are essential when working with more complex CosmWasm contracts.

# Advanced CosmWasm Contract Interactions Through the WASM Precompile

## Introduction

While our basic counter example demonstrated simple contract interactions, CosmWasm contracts offer much more sophisticated capabilities than traditional EVM contracts. One of their most powerful features is their ability to describe their own interfaces, eliminating the need for external ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces) that are required for EVM contract interactions.

In this guide, we'll explore these advanced features and learn how to build more complex applications that leverage the full power of CosmWasm contracts through SHE's WASM precompile.

## Understanding CosmWasm Contract Discovery

Unlike EVM contracts where you need detailed interface specifications beforehand, CosmWasm contracts can tell you exactly how to interact with them. This self-describing capability makes them particularly developer-friendly and reduces the chance of interface mismatches.

Let's explore how to implement this discovery mechanism:

```typescript copy
async function discoverContractMethods(contractAddress: string) {
  // We intentionally send an invalid query - the contract will respond with valid methods
  const invalidQuery = { a: 'b' };

  try {
    await contract.query(contractAddress, toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(invalidQuery)));
    // If we reach here, something unexpected happened
    console.log('Unexpected success - contract accepted invalid query');
    return null;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.data) {
      const errorMessage = toUtf8String(error.data);

      // The error message contains a list of valid methods
      // Format: "expected one of method1, method2, method3: query wasm contract failed"
      const match = errorMessage.match(/expected one of (.+): query wasm contract failed/);
      if (match) {
        const validMethods = match[1]
          .replace(/`/g, '')
          .split(', ')
          .map((method) => method.trim());
        console.log('Valid query methods:', validMethods);
        return validMethods;
      }
    }
    console.error('Unexpected error structure:', error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

When we run this against a CW721 (NFT) contract, we might receive a response like this:

```javascript copy
[
  'owner_of', // Query the owner of a specific token
  'approval', // Check if an address is approved for a token
  'approvals', // List all approvals for a token
  'operator', // Check if an address is an operator
  'all_operators', // List all operators
  'num_tokens', // Get total supply of tokens
  'contract_info', // Get contract metadata
  'nft_info', // Get metadata for a specific token
  'all_nft_info', // Get all info for a specific token
  'tokens', // List tokens owned by an address
  'all_tokens', // List all tokens in the collection
  'minter', // Get the minting authority
  'extension', // Access CW721 extensions
  'ownership' // Query contract ownership
];
```

## Building an NFT Information Component

Let's create a practical example that uses these discovered methods to interact with a CW721 contract. This component will display both collection-wide information and individual token details:

```typescript copy
function NFTViewer() {
  const [methods, setMethods] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const [collectionOwner, setCollectionOwner] = useState<string>();
  const [tokenOwner, setTokenOwner] = useState<string>();
  const [contract, setContract] = useState<Contract>();
  const [tokenId, setTokenId] = useState<string>('1');
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

  const NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "she1g2a0q3tddzs7vf7lk45c2tgufsaqerxmsdr2cprth3mjtuqxm60qdmravc";

  // Query collection ownership
  const queryCollectionOwner = async () => {
    try {
      // The ownership query returns collection-level ownership information
      const queryMsg = { ownership: {} };
      const queryResponse = await contract.query(
        NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(queryMsg))
      );
      const responseData = JSON.parse(toUtf8String(queryResponse));

      // Handle different response formats - some contracts nest data differently
      const owner = responseData.data?.owner || responseData.owner;
      setCollectionOwner(owner);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error querying collection owner:', error);
    }
  };

  // Query specific token ownership
  const queryTokenOwner = async (tokenId: string) => {
    try {
      setIsLoading(true);
      // The owner_of query returns ownership information for a specific token
      const queryMsg = { owner_of: { token_id: tokenId } };
      const queryResponse = await contract.query(
        NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(queryMsg))
      );
      const responseData = JSON.parse(toUtf8String(queryResponse));
      const owner = responseData.data?.owner || responseData.owner;
      setTokenOwner(owner);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error querying token owner:', error);
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };

  // Discover available methods when component mounts or contract changes
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!contract) return;
    discoverContractMethods(NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS)
      .then(setMethods);
  }, [contract]);

  return (
    <div className="nft-viewer">
      <h2>NFT Collection Info</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Collection Address: {NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS}</p>
        <p>Collection Owner: {collectionOwner || 'Loading...'}</p>
        <p>Available Methods: {methods?.join(', ') || 'Loading...'}</p>
      </div>

      <div className="token-lookup">
        <h3>Token Ownership Lookup</h3>
        <div className="input-group">
          <input
            type="text"
            value={tokenId}
            onChange={(e) => setTokenId(e.target.value)}
            placeholder="Enter token ID"
          />
          <button
            onClick={() => queryTokenOwner(tokenId)}
            disabled={isLoading}
          >
            {isLoading ? 'Searching...' : 'Look Up Token'}
          </button>
        </div>
        {tokenOwner && (
          <div className="token-result">
            <p>Token {tokenId} Owner: {tokenOwner}</p>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Understanding CosmWasm Response Formats

CosmWasm contracts can return data in various formats, and it's important to handle these variations properly. Here are some example responses you might receive:

- Collection Ownership Query Response:

```json copy
{
  "owner": "she1hjsqrfdg2hvwl3gacg4fkznurf36usrv7rkzkyh29wz3guuzeh0snslz7d",
  "pending_owner": null,
  "pending_expiry": null
}
```

- Token Ownership Query Response:

```json copy
{
  "owner": "she1frcndtm928xln5awxz4rcrh3f5exskjczrc92f",
  "approvals": []
}
```

Notice how these responses have different structures. That's why our code uses a flexible approach to extract the owner:

```typescript copy
const owner = responseData.data?.owner || responseData.owner;
```

## Creating a Reusable Query Function

To make contract interactions more maintainable, consider creating a reusable query function:

```typescript copy
async function queryContract(address: string, queryMsg: object) {
  try {
    const response = await contract.query(address, toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(queryMsg)));

    const result = JSON.parse(toUtf8String(response));
    // Handle both nested and direct data structures
    return result.data ?? result;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.data) {
      const errorMessage = toUtf8String(error.data);
      // Check if this is a method discovery error
      if (errorMessage.includes('expected one of')) {
        console.log('Available methods:', errorMessage);
      }
    }
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Best Practices for CosmWasm Contract Interactions

When building applications that interact with CosmWasm contracts through the WASM precompile, follow these guidelines:

1. **Always Start with Discovery**: Use the contract's self-describing capabilities to understand its interface. This prevents errors and makes your code more maintainable.

2. **Handle Response Variations**: CosmWasm contracts might return data in different formats. Always implement robust response parsing that can handle various structures.

3. **Implement Proper Error Handling**: CosmWasm contracts provide detailed error messages that can help diagnose issues. Make use of this information in your error handling.

4. **Manage Loading States**: Always provide clear feedback about the state of contract interactions to improve user experience.

5. **Cache Method Information**: Consider caching the discovered methods to reduce unnecessary queries, but make sure to refresh this cache periodically.

## Error Handling Examples

Here's how to handle different types of errors you might encounter:

```typescript copy
try {
  const result = await queryContract(address, queryMsg);
  // Handle success
} catch (error) {
  if (error.data) {
    const errorMessage = toUtf8String(error.data);
    if (errorMessage.includes('expected one of')) {
      // This is a method discovery error - might be useful!
      console.log('Valid methods:', errorMessage);
    } else if (errorMessage.includes('not found')) {
      // Handle non-existent tokens or resources
      console.log('Resource not found');
    } else {
      // Handle other contract-specific errors
      console.log('Contract error:', errorMessage);
    }
  } else {
    // Handle network or other errors
    console.error('Network or system error:', error);
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

CosmWasm contracts offer powerful capabilities that go beyond traditional EVM contracts. Their self-describing nature and flexible query system make them particularly well-suited for building robust and maintainable applications. By understanding and leveraging these features through the WASM precompile, you can create more sophisticated and user-friendly applications on the SHE network.

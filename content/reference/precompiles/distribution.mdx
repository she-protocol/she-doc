    /// @param address The EVM Address that withdrawals should go to.
    /// @return Whether the operation was a success.
    function setWithdrawAddress(
        address withdrawAddr
    ) external returns (bool success);
  ```

- `withdrawDelegationRewards`: Withdraws delegation rewards from the given
  validator.
  ```solidity copy
    /// Withdraws delegation rewards from the given validator.
    /// @param validator The SHE address of the validator to withdraw rewards from.

  function withdrawMultipleDelegationRewards(
        string[] memory validators
  ) external returns (bool success);
```

### Queries

- `rewards`: Queries rewards available for a given delegator address.

```solidity copy
  struct Coin {
      uint256 amount;
      uint256 decimals;
      string denom;
  }

  struct Reward {
      Coin[] coins;
      string validator_address;
  }

  struct Rewards {
      Reward[] rewards;
      Coin[] total;
  }
  /// Queries rewards available for a given delegator address.
  /// @param delegatorAddress The x0 or SHE address of the delegator.
  /// @return the Rewards object. Rewards are usually returned as decimals.
  /// To calculate the actual amount, divide the amount by decimals.
  function rewards(
      address delegatorAddress
  ) external view returns (Rewards rewards);
